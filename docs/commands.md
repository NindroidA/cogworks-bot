The bait channel system can be configured through the main setup wizard with basic settings:

- Action type (Ban/Kick/Log Only)
- Grace period (0-60 seconds)
- Optional log channel

### Advanced Configuration
**`/baitchannel setup channel:[channel] grace_period:[0-60] action:[ban|kick|log-only] log_channel:[channel]`**
- Complete bait channel configuration
- `channel` - The hidden bait channel
- `grace_period` - Seconds to wait before action (0-60)
- `action` - What to do when bot detected (ban/kick/log-only)
- `log_channel` - Optional logging channel

**`/baitchannel detection enabled:[true|false]`**
- Configure smart detection settings
- Optional parameters:
  - `min_account_age` - Minimum account age in days (0-365)

### How It Works
1. Create a hidden text channel with no permissions for @everyone
2. Configure it as the bait channel
3. Automated bots often try to access all visible channels
4. When someone joins the bait channel, they're flagged
5. System takes configured action (ban/kick/log)
6. All detections are logged with timestamps and user info

### Security Features
- **Smart Detection**: Filter by account age, server membership, message count
- **Whitelist System**: Protect trusted users and roles
- **Grace Period**: Give users time to leave before action
- **Detailed Logging**: Track all detections with full context
- **Statistics**: Monitor bot activity over time
