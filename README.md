# cogworks-bot

Discord ticketing bot developed for ease-of-use

## Details

This is just a personal project for a Discord server I help maintain. Overall, this bot is pretty niche and is really only intended for my personal use. Right now this is purely in development, and I still have a lot to work on.

I've gotten much done with how I want the bot to work, so I've started adding it to this repo not only for backing it up but also for when I'm ready to start testing on my home server.
