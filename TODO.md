# Priority
[] deprecate the env variable GUILD_ID

# Here-and-There
[] have a way to transfer email appeals/tickets into the discord
[] make the console logging a lot better in case of unknown issues

# Back-Burner
[] maybe change the admin only replies just to make things look nicer (not a priority)
[] maybe make an archive for tickets that are made admin only?
[] maybe make a revert button for the admin only button?

# Completed

[x] make sure staff and admins can also close the ticket (or make tickets admin only)
