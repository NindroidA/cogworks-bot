## Completed Tasks
[x] do the logic of getting each saved role (if any) and add them to the perms of ticket channels
[x] make command for ticket 'admin only' (removes everyone from being able to see the ticket except for ticket creator and admins)
[x] fix styling with admin only button and cancel button
